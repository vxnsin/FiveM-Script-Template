# FiveM Script Template

## Description

This is a basic template for a **FiveM script**. It contains essential files to help you get started with scripting for FiveM:

- **fxmanifest.lua**: Defines the resource metadata and scripts.
- **client.lua**: Client-side script (runs on the playerâ€™s client).
- **server.lua**: Server-side script (runs on the server).

You can use this template as a foundation for building your own FiveM resources.
